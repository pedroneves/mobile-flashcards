# Mobile Flashcards Project

This is my own implementation of a mobile version of the Flashcards training exercise, part of the Udacity React Nanodegree.

With this app, you will be able to create decks of question cards, to help you consolidate the subject you are studying. The following list is what you can do:

- Creat a deck of question cards;
- Add a card and an answer to a deck;
- Do de quiz game for a specific deck;
- Get the results of a quiz game;

## Installation

Clone this repo and, inside the cloned rep, run:

    $ yarn install

Also, it's required you to download the Expo Client for [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/expo-client/id982107779) or [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent&hl=en_US)

## Laching

After installation, run:

    $ yarn start

The service will be running on your local network. With the Expo Client installed on your phone, read the QR code presented on your terminal.

The Mobile Flashcards app should load automatically.

For a better performance, activate the [production mode](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/development-mode/).
